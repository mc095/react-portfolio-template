# 🌟 Minimalistic React Portfolio Template

Hey there! 👋 I'm excited to share my portfolio template with you. I built this using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS to create a clean, modern portfolio that's super easy to customize. The best part? You just need to update one JSON file with your info, and you're good to go!

## 🎯 What Makes This Special?

I wanted to create something that's:
- 🌙 **Clean & Dark**: A sleek dark theme that's easy on the eyes
- 📱 **Responsive**: Looks great on everything from phones to desktops
- ⚡ **Fast**: Built with Vite for lightning-quick loading
- 🎨 **Easy to Make Your Own**: Just edit one JSON file!

## 👀 Take a Look!

Here's what you get:

| Home | Experience | Projects |
|------|------------|----------|
| ![Home Page](./public/screenshots/home.png) | ![Experience Page](./public/screenshots/exp.png) | ![Projects Page](./public/screenshots/projects.png) |
